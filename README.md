A solution for Frontend Mentor's QR code component 

Hi! This repository is created to submit a solution for the QR code component challange in Frontend Mentor.
This challenge really helped me with my CSS skill since CSS layout stuffs are quite hard for me to get used to.
Throughout the process, I found that the challenge was more enjoyable than I thought and it took me 2 hours to finish this, mostly for sizing the layout.
However, since CSS layouts are new for me, I think the code I wrote is quite messy. 
Overall, it was fun and the outcome was very impressive. I'm pround of myself. Can't wait to get better and better.
